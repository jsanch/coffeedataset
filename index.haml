      %ul
        %li
          Which tool(s) did you use?
          %p I used d3 and Tableau. 
        %li
          Did you preprocess the data? Why or why not?
          %p I used python to parse the csv and aggregate sales and profit by month.
        %li
          What visual mappings / representations did you choose? Why those?
          %p I chose a dual y-axis line graph. This is a good way to compare quantitative financial data with a temporal component
        %li
          Are there any patterns/trends in the data that your visualization highlights?
          %p Yes, from a financial standpoint I can see that the Coffee company's profits went up during december of 2010. Moreover the company became  profitable (that is, the profits are more than the sales) around the May-June of 2012 period.
        %li
          Is your visualization useful? If yes, how so? If no, why not?
          %p I think my visualization is very useful. It gives a very good overview of the company's financial standing, along with a (if the user hovers on it) detailed month-month report
        %li
          Was anything harder than you expected? Easier?
          %p 
            There are many examples for d3 line graphs, however none incorporated the features i wanted. It was hard to apply a dual y axis implementation to some features like when you mousehover the two focus circles appear.
